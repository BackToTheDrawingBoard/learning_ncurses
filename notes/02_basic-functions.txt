See source/ncurses_skeleton.c for basic init and closing functions.

Attributes
 - Possible with OR-ing a char with flags in addch, e.g.
      addch(ch | A_BOLD | A_UNDERLINE);
 - Use attrset(), attron(), arrtoff() with the attribute flags

Capturing unbuffered input
	Without somekind of action, stdin remains buffered, and will only report
	keystrokes to programs upon encountering a newline or EOF character.
	ncurses provides two functions to deal with this issue:
 - raw()
		raw() gives you all of the keyboard input in the terminal window,
		even strokes like C-c, C-x, and the like, which would normally
		generate signals.
 - cbreak()
 		cbreak() essentially just unbuffers stdin, as I understand it.
